# netflix-roulette

Simple App practice with React + React Router + Redux Toolkit.

## Get started ##

### To write the front-end, I used a third-party backend.
### Run backend side

At some point you will have to start integrating with the backend HTTP API.
The backend is already implemented for you. To access it, follow these steps:

Clone the source repository: 
```bash
https://github.com/VarvaraZadnepriak/MoviesAPI.ReactJS
```

Run:
```bash
npm install
```
Run:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start at http://localhost:4000.
You can find the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:4000/api-docs.

### Install and start Frontend side 

```bash
npm install
```

Run project and open http://localhost:3001.
```bash
npm run start
```

Run tests
```bash
npm run test
```

Run test cypress
```bash
npm run cypress
```
